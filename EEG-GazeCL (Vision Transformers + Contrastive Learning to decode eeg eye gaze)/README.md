EEG-GazeCL (original architecture + original methodology)

Contrastive Spatial Decoding of Gaze from EEG

EEG-GazeCL is a deep learning framework for decoding spatial gaze targets from EEG signals.
It learns spatially consistent embeddings using a Vision-Transformer-style EEG encoder and distance-aware contrastive learning.

Evaluated on the EEGEyeNet dataset, EEG-GazeCL achieves improved spatial accuracy, reduced catastrophic errors, and smoother gaze predictions compared to standard classification baselines.

------------------- Key Ideas

EEG gaze decoding is inherently spatial, not just categorical.

Standard cross-entropy treats all errors equally — spatial contrastive learning differentiates nearby vs. far errors.

Nearby gaze targets → nearby embeddings; far targets → well-separated embeddings.

Regularization is applied early in training, then annealed.

------------------Model Overview

Input: EEG trials of shape (128 channels × 500 time samples)

Backbone: EEG Vision Transformer (EEGViT)

Temporal convolution → creates time patches

Spatial convolution → groups channels

Transformer encoder with CLS token

Outputs:

Gaze class (discrete dot)

Latent embedding (used for spatial regularization)

--------Spatial Contrastive Learning

We introduce a distance-aware spatial contrastive loss:
∥zi​−zj​∥∝∥gi​−gj​∥


Where:

𝑧_i = EEG embedding

g_i = 2D gaze position


Key design choices:

Contrastive loss applied only in early epochs (annealing)

Gaussian distance weighting

Combined with standard cross-entropy

 ---------Evaluation Metrics

Beyond standard classification accuracy, we measure:

Median pixel error

Mean pixel error

P(exact): exact dot prediction

P(within 1 step): nearest neighbor

P(within 2 steps): two spatial steps

This gives a faithful evaluation of spatial gaze decoding quality.

---------------Dataset

EEGEyeNet – Position Task (Dot Targets)

Each subject file contains:

EEG: (N, T, C) EEG trials

labels: (N, 3) → [trial_id, x, y]

Multiple subjects are stored as separate .npz files and merged during training.

---------------Results (Single Subject)

After spatial contrastive learning + annealing:

Exact accuracy: ~45% (no paper really has fine grained decoding for the exact spatial coordinates out there, so it's pretty hard w/ eeg data)

Within 1 step: ~54%

Within 2 steps: ~71%

Median pixel error: ~55 px (SOTA)

Errors are mostly local, with rare catastrophic failures.
